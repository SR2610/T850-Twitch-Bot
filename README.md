# T850 Twitch Bot
  

### About
This is a bot for my twitch.tv stream that allows viewers to interact with the stream!  See it in action over on [my channel](https://www.twitch.tv/sr2610).
  

### Current Features

 - Reading twitch chat to know when channel points have been redeemed.
 - Sending messages to Phillips Hue to change light colours or turn them off.
 - Changing scenes in OBS Studio via [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket).


### Planned Features

 - Responding to messages in the twitch chat via the bot.
 - Picking out commands from twitch chat to respond to them and perform actions.
 - Performing actions on interactions such as subscriptions, follows, bits and donations.

### Notes
Currently this bot is only designed to work with how my channel and my home is set up, so it will require some tweaking to adapt it elsewhere.
